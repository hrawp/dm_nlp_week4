  "lyrics": "Here come old flat top he come growing up slowly\r\nHe got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller\r\nHe got hair down to his knees\r\nGot to be a joker he just do what he please\r\nHe wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam football\n\nHe got monkey finger he shoot coca-cola\n\nHe say \"I know you, you know me\"\n\nOne thing I can tell you is you got to be free\n\nCome together right now over me\n\n\n\nHe bag production he got walrus gumboot\n\nHe got Ono sideboard he one spinal cracker\n\nHe got feet down below his knees\n\nHold you in his armchair you can feel his disease\n\nCome together right now over me\n\n\n\nHe roller-coaster he got only warning\n\nHe got muddy water he one mojo filter\n\nHe say \"One and one and one is three\"\n\nGot to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see\n\nCome together right now over me."
