  "lyrics": "Something in the way she moves\r\nAttracts me like no other lover\r\nSomething in the way she woos me\r\nI don't want to leave her now\r\nYou know I believe and how\n\n\n\nSomewhere in her smile she knows\n\nThat I don't need no other lover\n\nSomething in her style that shows me\n\n\n\nI don't want to leave her now\n\nYou know I believe and how\n\n\n\nYou're asking me will my love grow\n\nI don't know, I don't know\n\nYou stick around and it may show\n\nI don't know, I don't know\n\n\n\nSomething in the way she knows\n\nAnd all I have to do is think of her\n\nSomething in the things she shows me\n\n\n\nI don't want to leave her now\n\nYou know I believe and how"
