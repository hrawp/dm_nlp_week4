# Requests, JSON, and basic NLP with spaCy

In this weeks project.  I connected to an API for music lyrics.  In my first function I brought in the JSON and wrote it to a file.  I just called the function indiviudally four times since the API call did not always work.  I did this for four songs by the Beatles. 

In my second function I opened each file and printed the lyrics along with a polarity and subjectvity score.  I called the function four times for the four songs.
